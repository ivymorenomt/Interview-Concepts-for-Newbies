## Welcome to Interview Concepts for Newbies / Refreshers

In 2023, approximately 1,186 tech companies laid off employees, surpassing the combined totals for 2021 and 2022. As of October 2024, around 124,000 workers have been laid off in the tech sector, with over 57,000 layoffs occurring internationally.

I got laid off twice - 2023 and 2024, it's been a fun ride! I got bored and compiled all my notes from different sources, with simple examples.
