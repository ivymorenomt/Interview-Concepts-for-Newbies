### **What is SQL?**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data. It is supported by many database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

---

### **Basic SQL Commands**
1. **Show Existing Databases**:
   ```sql
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```
   **Output**:
   ```
   information_schema
   mysql
   sakila
   student
   ```

2. **Create a Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE bank;
   ```

3. **Use a Database**:
   ```sql
   USE bank;
   ```

4. **Drop a Database**:
   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE student;
   ```

---

### **Table Operations**
1. **Create a Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Employee (
       EmployeeID INT,
       FirstName VARCHAR(50),
       LastName VARCHAR(50),
       Email VARCHAR(100),
       DOB DATE
   );
   ```

2. **Show Tables**:
   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

3. **Drop a Table**:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE Employee;
   ```

4. **Insert Values**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1111, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '1990-01-01');
   ```

5. **Select All Data**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employee;
   ```

---

### **Constraints**
1. **NOT NULL**: Ensures a column cannot have null values.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customer (
       CustID INT NOT NULL,
       Name VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

2. **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Product (
       ProductID INT UNIQUE,
       ProductName VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

3. **PRIMARY KEY**: Ensures uniqueness and non-null values.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customer (
       CustID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

4. **FOREIGN KEY**: Creates a relationship between two tables.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT,
       CustID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustID) REFERENCES Customer(CustID)
   );
   ```

---

### **Data Retrieval and Filtering**
1. **WHERE Clause**: Filters data based on a condition.
   ```sql
   SELECT AccNo, CurBal FROM Account WHERE CurBal >= 1000;
   ```

2. **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts the results in ascending or descending order.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Account ORDER BY CurBal DESC;
   ```

3. **GROUP BY Clause**: Groups data for aggregation.
   ```sql
   SELECT AType, COUNT(*) FROM Account GROUP BY AType;
   ```

4. **HAVING Clause**: Filters aggregated data.
   ```sql
   SELECT AType, MAX(CurBal) FROM Account GROUP BY AType HAVING MAX(CurBal) > 5000;
   ```

---

### **Join Operations**
1. **INNER JOIN**: Fetches matching rows from both tables.
   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustID = Orders.CustID;
   ```

2. **LEFT JOIN**: Fetches all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustID = Orders.CustID;
   ```

3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Fetches all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustID = Orders.CustID;
   ```

4. **FULL JOIN**: Fetches all rows from both tables.
   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustID = Orders.CustID;
   ```

5. **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself.
   ```sql
   SELECT A.EmpID, B.EmpID
   FROM Employee A, Employee B
   WHERE A.ManagerID = B.EmpID;
   ```

---

### **Other Concepts**
1. **Aggregate Functions**:
   - **COUNT**: Counts rows.
   - **MAX/MIN**: Finds maximum or minimum values.
   - **SUM**: Sums up numeric columns.
   - **AVG**: Calculates the average.

   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee;
   ```

2. **Union**:
   Combines results from two queries.
   ```sql
   SELECT Name FROM Employees
   UNION
   SELECT Name FROM Customers;
   ```

---

### **Simple Example Workflow**
1. Create a Database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE MyShop;
   USE MyShop;
   ```

2. Create Tables:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(50)
   );
   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustID INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (CustID) REFERENCES Customers(CustID)
   );
   ```

3. Insert Data:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Customers VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');
   INSERT INTO Orders VALUES (101, 1), (102, 2);
   ```

4. Query Data:
   ```sql
   SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderID
   FROM Customers
   INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustID = Orders.CustID;
   ```

**Output**:
```
Name    OrderID
Alice   101
Bob     102
```

Indexing in databases is a technique used to improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. While indexing can significantly enhance performance, it also has drawbacks that need careful consideration.

---

### **Advantages of Indexing**

1. **Faster Query Performance**:
   - Indexes reduce the time it takes to find data, especially in large datasets, by avoiding full table scans.
   - Example: Retrieving rows based on a column with an index is much quicker than scanning every row.

2. **Efficient Sorting and Filtering**:
   - Indexes are particularly useful for operations involving `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, or filtering with `WHERE` clauses.

3. **Improved Join Operations**:
   - Indexing can speed up join queries by making it easier to locate matching rows in related tables.

4. **Supports Uniqueness Constraints**:
   - Unique indexes (e.g., primary keys) enforce the uniqueness of values in a column, ensuring data integrity.

5. **Speeds Up Aggregate Functions**:
   - Queries using aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) on indexed columns are faster since the index allows quick access to the relevant rows.

6. **Better Performance for Range Queries**:
   - Range-based conditions (e.g., `BETWEEN`, `>`, `<`) benefit from indexes as they can quickly locate and retrieve the relevant rows.

7. **Reduces Disk I/O**:
   - Indexes minimize the need to read unnecessary rows from disk, improving overall performance.

---

### **Disadvantages of Indexing**

1. **Increased Storage Requirements**:
   - Indexes consume additional disk space, which can be significant for large datasets with multiple indexes.

2. **Slower Write Operations**:
   - **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, and **DELETE** operations become slower because the database must update the indexes in addition to the data.

3. **Maintenance Overhead**:
   - Indexes need regular maintenance (e.g., rebuilding, reorganizing) to remain efficient, especially in databases with frequent write operations.

4. **Not Useful for All Queries**:
   - Indexes are ineffective for queries that:
     - Do not use indexed columns.
     - Have high selectivity (e.g., fetching most of the table's rows).

5. **Risk of Over-Indexing**:
   - Adding too many indexes can:
     - Increase maintenance overhead.
     - Slow down write operations significantly.
     - Lead to inefficient use of storage.

6. **Complexity in Index Design**:
   - Designing the right indexes requires expertise and an understanding of query patterns.
   - Poorly designed indexes can degrade performance instead of improving it.

7. **Performance Impact on Large Datasets**:
   - Over time, as data grows, indexes can become fragmented, leading to degraded performance.

8. **Increased Memory Usage**:
   - Query execution with indexes often requires more memory for caching and managing the index structures.

---

### **When to Use Indexing**
Indexing is most beneficial when:
- There are frequent read operations (e.g., SELECT queries).
- Queries involve filtering (`WHERE`), sorting (`ORDER BY`), or joining (`JOIN`) columns.
- Columns have high cardinality (unique values).

---

### **When to Avoid Excessive Indexing**
Avoid or minimize indexing when:
- The dataset undergoes frequent writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- The database is small, as the overhead of managing indexes may outweigh the performance benefits.
- Queries frequently access most of the table's rows (e.g., analytical queries on entire datasets).

---

Indexing is a powerful tool to enhance query performance, but its trade-offs, such as increased storage and slower write operations, require careful planning. Proper indexing strategies, such as indexing only frequently queried columns and monitoring index performance, can maximize benefits while minimizing drawbacks.

**SQL Injection** is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in a database query by injecting malicious SQL code into user inputs. This can result in unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or even complete database compromise.

---

### **How SQL Injection Works**

1. **Vulnerable Query**:
   - If a web application directly includes user input in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation, it becomes vulnerable.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'user' AND password = 'pass';
     ```

2. **Malicious Input**:
   - An attacker injects malicious SQL code instead of valid input.
   - Example Input: `' OR 1=1 --`
   - Resulting Query:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = '';
     ```
   - The `OR 1=1` always evaluates to true, and `--` comments out the rest of the query, bypassing authentication.

---

### **Types of SQL Injection**

1. **Classic SQL Injection**:
   - Injecting malicious SQL into a query.
   - Example: `' OR 1=1 --`

2. **Blind SQL Injection**:
   - No visible error messages; attackers infer data by observing application behavior.
   - Example:
     - Injecting `' AND 1=1 --` (valid) vs. `' AND 1=2 --` (invalid) to deduce information.

3. **Error-Based SQL Injection**:
   - Exploits detailed database error messages to extract information.
   - Example: `' UNION SELECT null, version() --` to retrieve the database version.

4. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**:
   - Exploits time delays to deduce information.
   - Example: `' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) --` causes a delay if the condition is true.

5. **Union-Based SQL Injection**:
   - Combines results from multiple queries.
   - Example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM admin --`

---

### **Defending Against SQL Injection**

1. **Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**:
   - Replace dynamic query construction with placeholders and bind parameters.
   - Example in Python (using SQLite):
     ```python
     import sqlite3

     username = input("Enter username: ")
     password = input("Enter password: ")

     conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
     cursor = conn.cursor()
     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
     cursor.execute(query, (username, password))
     result = cursor.fetchone()
     ```

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Validate user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats.
   - Reject inputs with special characters like `'`, `--`, `;`, or other SQL-specific tokens.

3. **Use Stored Procedures**:
   - Encapsulate SQL logic within the database itself.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE PROCEDURE authenticate_user (IN username VARCHAR(255), IN password VARCHAR(255))
     BEGIN
         SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = username AND password = password;
     END;
     ```

4. **Limit User Privileges**:
   - Use the principle of least privilege.
   - Ensure application accounts have restricted permissions, e.g., no direct access to sensitive tables or data.

5. **Escape Special Characters**:
   - Escape characters like single quotes to prevent injection.
   - Example in PHP:
     ```php
     $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $username);
     ```

6. **Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**:
   - Frameworks like SQLAlchemy (Python) or Hibernate (Java) abstract SQL queries and reduce injection risks.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Disable detailed error messages in production to prevent attackers from gaining insight.
   - Log errors instead of displaying them to users.

8. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**:
   - Deploy WAFs to detect and block malicious SQL payloads.

9. **Database-Specific Defenses**:
   - Use features like:
     - MySQL's `SQL_MODE=NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES`.
     - SQL Server's `QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` and `SET NOCOUNT`.

10. **Regular Security Audits**:
    - Conduct periodic penetration testing and code reviews.
    - Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities.

---

### **Best Practices Example**

#### **Vulnerable Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "';
```

#### **Secured with Prepared Statements**:
```python
import sqlite3

def authenticate_user(username, password):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
    cursor.execute(query, (username, password))
    return cursor.fetchone()
```
